<p>Fitst Sighting of the Weird Litle guy, October 12, 1999. I saw him outside the laundromat. I was doing my laundry and I looked 
up and I saw him and he said "hello" (hi) and just like that he was gone. </p>  
<p>Second Sightning of the Weird Little Guy: It was late in 2001, December or Maybe it was January 2002. I can't remember exactly, but I was
Hiking with my brother near Fort Eerie. I saw him through the trees and he said Hi. After I blinked he was gone. My brother didn't see him and thinks that I made it up.</p>
