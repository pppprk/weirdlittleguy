<p><u><font color="#0000ff">jerhico@hmail.com 00:12:01:2022:</font>/</u> First Sighting of the Weird Litle guy, October 12, 1999. I saw him outside the laundromat. I was doing my laundry and I looked 
up and I saw him and he said "hello" (hi) and just like that he was gone.Second Sightning of the Weird Little Guy: It was late in 2001, December or Maybe it was January 2002. I can't remember exactly, but I was
Hiking with my brother near Fort Eerie. I saw him through the trees and he said Hi. After I blinked he was gone. My brother didn't see him and thinks that I made it up.</p>

<hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Pinesol_smeller@hmail.com 02:59:45:2021:</font>/</u> I see him all the time. I see him and I cherish Him. I saw him last night over my shoulder in the reflection of a car mirror and I heard his voice saying Hi. My family thinks I'm fucking nuts. Whatever!</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Magickarp12948@hottmail.com 04:33:23:2020:</font>/</u> I went ice skating with my aunt and uncle last night and there was like 400 people there on the ice and I kept thinking for sure that I would see him there but no dice. Later that night though I was reading my bible and poof what do you know. He said "Hi" </p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Black_lotus_owner_1999@hottmail.com 02:34:24:2020:</font>/</u> I saw him. I cherish Him. He said Hi.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">doctorlove1977@hmail.com 00:50:01:2020:</font>/</u> Firstly I can't believe there's a community for this but secondly or maybe actually primarily I can't believe that I'm a part of it. I see him all the time. He says Hi. I see him and I need answers. I'm actually kind of terrified of him and the first few times I saw him I screamed but I'm getting used to it, idk. What the hell is going on. I can't even read my bible anymore.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Smelts_on_toast@hottmail.com 05:42:2019:</font>/</u> Greetings from the UK everyone. Just here to confirm that. YES, our lad has crossed the pond. Saw him in London last week and again while in Lancashire today visiting my uncles grave. Never made ammends with the man after I smoked all of his weed that one time, but that's another story!! Long one short: I see Him. I cherish Him. Email me if in London, always ready to meet up for a pint.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">woccawocca@hmail.com 00:20:12:2019:</font>/</u> Seriously don't even know where to start. I see this guy everywhere. What is he even??? I can't even deal with it anymore, so I've been walking around with my damn eyes closed! Anyway, realistically, I cherish him. But I need answers. Email me. </p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Black_lotus_owner_1999@hottmail.com 01:22:34:2019:</font>/</u>Saw Him again, don't know what else to say. I don't want this. I think this might be a cult or something.</p> 
   <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Warped_reality@hottmail.com 04:45:34:2019:</font>/</u> I'm getting in touch because I need answers. There is no possible way that myself and so many others have been fooled into believing in this guy. I have seen him, yes, and yes, He said hi. That can be true and this can also be a huge hoax or a cult or some other bullshit, i don't even know. I need answers.</p>
