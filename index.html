<p><u><font color="#0000ff">jerhico@hmail.com 00:12:01:2022:</font>/</u> First Sighting of the Weird Litle guy, October 12, 1999. I saw him outside the laundromat. I was doing my laundry and I looked 
up and I saw him and he said "hello" (hi) and just like that he was gone.Second Sightning of the Weird Little Guy: It was late in 2001, December or Maybe it was January 2002. I can't remember exactly, but I was
Hiking with my brother near Fort Eerie. I saw him through the trees and he said Hi. After I blinked he was gone. My brother didn't see him and thinks that I made it up.</p>
<hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Sport_fam_1999@hottmail.com 01:12:56:2021:</font>/</u> Saw him at the park again. Said hi. I Cherish Him.</p>
<hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Pinesol_smeller@hmail.com 02:59:45:2021:</font>/</u> I see him all the time. I see him and I cherish Him. I saw him last night over my shoulder in the reflection of a car mirror and I heard his voice saying Hi. My family thinks I'm fucking nuts. Whatever!</p>
<hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Magickarp12948@hottmail.com 09:43:23:2021:</font>/</u> I don't think he's real and yall are fucking nuts. Just kidding. Saw him again. He said Hi. I cherish Him.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Magickarp12948@hottmail.com 04:33:23:2020:</font>/</u> I went ice skating with my aunt and uncle last night and there was like 400 people there on the ice and I kept thinking for sure that I would see him there but no dice. Later that night though I was reading my bible and poof what do you know. He said "Hi" </p>
  <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Black_lotus_owner_1999@hottmail.com 02:34:24:2020:</font>/</u> I saw him. I cherish Him. He said Hi.</p>
   <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">doctorlove1977@hmail.com 00:50:01:2020:</font>/</u> Firstly I can't believe there's a community for this but secondly or maybe actually primarily I can't believe that I'm a part of it. I see him all the time. He says Hi. I see him and I need answers. I'm actually kind of terrified of him and the first few times I saw him I screamed but I'm getting used to it, idk. What the hell is going on. I can't even read my bible anymore.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Smelts_on_toast@hottmail.com 05:42:2019:</font>/</u> Greetings from the UK everyone. Just here to confirm that. YES, our lad has crossed the pond. Saw him in London last week and again while in Lancashire today visiting my uncles grave. Never made ammends with the man after I smoked all of his weed that one time, but that's another story!! Long one short: I see Him. I cherish Him. Email me if in London, always ready to meet up for a pint.</p>
   <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">woccawocca@hmail.com 00:20:12:2019:</font>/</u> Seriously don't even know where to start. I see this guy everywhere. What is he even??? I can't even deal with it anymore, so I've been walking around with my damn eyes closed! Anyway, realistically, I cherish him. But I need answers. Email me. </p>
   <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Black_lotus_owner_1999@hottmail.com 01:22:34:2019:</font>/</u> Saw Him again, don't know what else to say. I don't want this. I think this might be a cult or something. I see him and I report here.</p> 
   <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Warped_reality@hottmail.com 04:45:34:2019:</font>/</u> I'm getting in touch because I need answers. There is no possible way that myself and so many others have been fooled into believing in this guy. I have seen him, yes, and yes, He said hi. That can be true and this can also be a huge hoax or a cult or some other bullshit, i don't even know. I need answers.</p>

  <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">pennyfarthing12@hottmail.com 05:10:21:2018:</font>/</u> I see him and I cherish him. I don't trust any of the naysayers and I doubt they even have seen him in the first place. I honestly don't remember what life was like before this. Can anyone? I keep emailing everyone I know telling them about what I know to be true but I keep getting automated responses.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">wigglyw0rld@hmail.com 04:28:36:2018:</font>/</u> There's ways to stop seeing him. Look it up.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">pennyfarthing@hottmail.com 03:02:33:2018:</font>/</u> I thought I knew what love meant - and you probably do as well, Looking at your kid or your favourite dog or whatever and feeling your admiration and pride - Trust me it's nothing. It's all just dust in the wind my friend. There's not any truth left in the world. There's isn't anything you'll experience as rewarding. When you see him and get a full "hello" there's no going back. I cherish him. I report here.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">pettycrimeiscoolbyme@progonemail.com 02:27:30:2018:</font>/</u> I saw him at the beach. He said hello. First full hello I've got, was pretty amazing, tbh. What happened next tho, he got on a surf board and he was like totally out there shredding the waves. I'm serious, I know normally he's just gone but he was totally out there. I waved while he was taking on this huge wave and he saw me and gave me the shaka hand gesture but then he bailed. The wave took him under. His board eventually washed up on the beach and I pulled it out, but no sign of him. I still have the board. I don't expect any of you to believe me, but it actually happened. </p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">june_mcdonald@hmail.com 02:20:33:2018:</font>/</u> Hello everyone. I don't understand what I am seeing or reading on this website, but as far as I can tell, I also see him. It's unpleasant. I'm interested in having this go away. Are we experience some kind of mental illness or mass delusion? I'm too embarassed to go to the doctor because of how ridiculous the situation is. I've started to wear dark glasses and I keep my head down while I'm out which has made it very difficult to drive. I'm new to this and I'd really love some advice if someone could email me. I think I need help. </p>

  <p><u><font color="#0000ff">Magickarp12948@hottmail.com@hmail.com 02:13:36:2018:</font>/</u> Saw him again today. Just "Hi" not full hello like before.</p>
